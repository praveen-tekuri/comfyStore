    - src (js files)
        - pages (about.js, products.js, product.js) (for every page) (get modules)
        - index.js for homepage (global & specific imports)
        - filters (companies.js, search.js, price.js)

    - fetch Products (async, fetch)
    - Store Setup (data inside this should be available throughout the applicatin)
       1. if there are multiple pages, better option is fetch the products only in homepage, and pass them into local storage, so we just grab the fetched data from the local storage. 
       2. massage the fetched data, where all the properties would be side by side. (destructure and return it)

- local storage
    - with this setup we can access the data in index / homepage but to get the data in any page, local storage is required
    - localStorage.setItem(name, JSON.stringify(item));
    - JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem(item))
- displaying featured products
    - filtered featured products from the store
    - product id as dynamic that reflects the product
    - data-id attribute

      - the price in this api is in cents ex: 999
      - payment processors like stripe, payapl or whatever, those are looking for the values in the smallest unit for that perticular currency

        - re-using displayProducts.js to display products
        - loading - even we're getting the data from local storage, when we navigate to this page from another page, it will take sometime to to update that. since we use this in the single product because there we will be fetching data.
    - filters (all these fitlers are not combined in this project (need more products to display))
        - search filter
            - get the value from input, keyup event on form

        - price filter
            - get the price-filter, price-value
            - get the prices from the products, find the max-price, and rounded it up
            - set the price-filter values such as max, value, min
            - set the price-value as max-price
            - input event on price-filter

    - 2. displayProducts.js 
        - it is having display function which has the code to display single product and addToCart function call on element.
        - everytime we click on add to cart button, we are calling this display function.
        - we also using this function in filters to filter out the products, so when we start using fitlers and add any item to the cart, the cart items being increased with unexpected count, because evertime we use fitlers we also calling event listeners (addToCart).
        - to fix this, conditionaly call the event listener in the display function, 
        - in case of fitlers, then return from display function. filters && return before the event. DONT call the event.
        - if we calling filters, we already working in the products, if we working in the products page, the event listener is already there, becasue every time we go to the products page, we will add that event listener.
